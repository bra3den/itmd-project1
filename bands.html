      <h2>Bands I like</h2>
      <p>These are all bands that I enjoy listening to, they have a pretty unique style and that's something I
        appreciate. Modern Baseball is the only band in this list with a real "logo" for their band, Old Gray's picture
        that I chose is just the cover art of one of their albums. Hot Mulligan uses their pink text "logo" sometimes on
        merch and posters for their concerts.</p>
